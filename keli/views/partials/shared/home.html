                    we want to pass on whatever experience we have to young minds.

                    We conduct seminars to help students understand that there are tons of options available and

                        On my birthday, November 5, the doorbell rang and there stood two smiling young men asking for a contribution on behalf of Oxfam India for the education of poor children.

                        I signed the papers for supporting the education of five children and my heart was filled with joy. I am grateful to Oxfam India for having given me the best birthday gift ever.

                        I feel privileged to be associated with Oxfam India in its fight against poverty and injustice.
                        I am really impressed with Oxfam India's works in areas of girl-child education and other activities for the poor. I also salute the dedication of their volunteers!
